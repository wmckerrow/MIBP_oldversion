This file contains constants for calculating pseudoknot penalty
for SHAPEknots program.


Constant 'a' is the single-stranded length. It is being  multiplied 
by unpaired nucleotide count. 
a is 	        --> 0.0

Constant 'b' is the nested helix length. It is being multiplied 
by number of internal branches.
b is 	        --> 15

Constants 'c#" is the internal pseudoknot length. It is being  multiplied 
by number of spanning helixes with length '#' nucleotides.
c2 is 	       	--> 0.0
c3 is 		--> 0.0
c4 is 		--> 0.0
c5 is 		--> 0.0
c6 is 		--> 0.0
c7 is 		--> 0.0
c8 is 		--> 0.0
c9 is 		--> 0.0
c10 is		--> 0.0
c11 is		--> 0.0
c12 is		--> 0.0
c13 is		--> 0.0
c14 is		--> 38

Constant 'c15' is multiplied by number of spanning helix longer then 14 nucleotides  
c15 is 		--> 42
